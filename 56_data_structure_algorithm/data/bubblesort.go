// Bubblesort sorts a slice of integers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.
//
// ðŸ”¹ items: slice of integers to be sorted
//
// Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements,
// and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
// The process repeats until no swaps are needed, indicating the slice is sorted.
//
// Time Complexity: O(n^2) on average and worst case
// Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting)
// âœ… Best for small datasets or educational purposes; not efficient for large datasets.
